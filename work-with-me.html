            <h2>How I got here</h2>
            <p>
                I spent the first 10 years of my career as a UX designer—doing research, prototyping, testing, pitching, and product validation. That's where I learned to think by doing, taking responsibility for problems end-to-end, not just following process because "that's how it's done."
            </p>
            <p>
                When I moved into product management and eventually leadership, I realized something important: I thrive when I'm close to the product and solving real problems with smart people. I like influence more than authority, ownership more than hierarchy, and clarity more than noise. I can manage people just fine, but I don't get energy from the traditional "people management mechanics"—what actually fuels me is progress, learning, and building good products.
            </p>

            <h2>What drives me</h2>
            <p>
                I like building things that matter. I enjoy creating clarity where there is none and bringing structure to messy problems. Progress, momentum, and impact motivate me—not titles, headcount, or ceremonies. I care about thinking clearly, being honest about problems, and improving the quality of decisions.
            </p>

            <h2>How I approach work</h2>
            <p><strong>Independent thinking</strong> – I don't default to "how others do it." I explore, challenge assumptions, and look for better answers.</p>
            <p><strong>Bias for action</strong> – Momentum matters. I'd rather run small experiments than debate hypotheticals.</p>
            <p><strong>Depth before decisions</strong> – Good decisions come from understanding the problem well, not jumping to solutions.</p>
            <p><strong>Flow matters</strong> – I do my deepest work alone, then bring it to the team to pressure-test and refine together.</p>
            <p><strong>Outcomes over outputs</strong> – I focus on the result and whether it makes a difference, not the volume of activity.</p>

            <h2>How I work with others</h2>
            <p>
                I prefer open and honest collaboration. I listen first, ask questions, and explore perspectives without ego. I enjoy working with people who bring their own thinking—not just tasks to check off.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't avoid disagreements. When done well, they make the work better. To me, debate is a sign of respect—it means I trust you enough to dig into the truth together.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't overlay my style on others. I adapt based on context and people—everyone works differently, and that's completely fine.
            </p>

            <h2>Communication with me</h2>
            <p>I appreciate clarity and context—tell me what you think and why. Short and clear beats long and vague. Async is often faster than meetings.</p>
            <p>If something is unclear, I'll ask direct questions—not to challenge you personally, but to find the truth faster.</p>
            <p>I don't react well to drama in groups, but I'm always available for real conversations 1:1.</p>

            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p>
                I see feedback as a normal part of working together—not a performance event. If something can be better, I'd rather discuss it early and fix it than smile politely and watch it fail. I'm direct by nature, but I always discuss ideas, not people. I appreciate the same in return.
            </p>

            <h2>How to get the best from me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Share problems early—I don't like surprises.</li>
                <li>Give me space for deep work, then pull me into the discussion.</li>
                <li>Ask for help when you need it—I assume things are fine unless told otherwise.</li>
                <li>If you disagree with me, say so. I respect people who think for themselves.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What I'm working on (self-awareness)</h2>
            <p>I know I naturally:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Give people a lot of autonomy, sometimes too much if they expect closer guidance.</li>
                <li>Focus heavily on improving things and may under-celebrate wins along the way.</li>
                <li>Help faster by doing than teaching—which is efficient short-term but limiting long-term.</li>
                <li>Overanalyze when priorities aren't clear—clear goals help me move faster.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                I'm actively working on being more intentional about support, celebrating progress, and scaling knowledge through better teaching instead of just jumping in to fix things myself.
            </p>

            <h2>How I work best</h2>
            <p><strong>Environment:</strong> Mix of focus time and collaboration</p>
            <p><strong>Style:</strong> Calm intensity, low ego, clear ownership</p>
            <p><strong>Speed:</strong> Fast but thoughtful</p>
            <p><strong>Schedule:</strong> Mornings are best for deep work; Fridays reserved for focus where possible</p>
            <p><strong>Balance:</strong> Family time matters; weekends are offline by default</p>
            <p><strong>Values:</strong> Honesty, responsibility, curiosity, quality</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 4rem; text-align: center;">—</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; color: #e0e0e0; margin-top: 2rem;">
                If you care about building good products, thinking clearly, and working with low ego and high trust, we'll work well together.
